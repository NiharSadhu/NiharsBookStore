On March 2, 2023, I created a new project on the lab computer to complete assignment 2. I set up ASP.NET MVC with core 3.1 and enabled HTTPS with individual account authentication. I reviewed the Areas folder, model, views, and controllers to ensure everything was properly set up.

At 15:09, I commented out the options part in Startup.cs and confirmed that the application was still functioning correctly. My action items included modifying the navigation, which resembled assignment 1, and changing the copyright from static to dynamic.

At 15:16, I made changes to the Welcome page and thoroughly tested them to ensure that they functioned as intended. I also added a comment to line 65 of Startup.cs.

The following day, on March 3 at 15:14, I resumed work on my project. At 15:23, I visited bootswatch.com to find appropriate themed templates for my project. I decided on the "Flatly" theme and navigated to the roots folder > lib > bootstrap > dist > css.

I updated the original bootstrap file name to bootstrap_bk.css while adding a new bootstrap file to the folder for the newly selected theme.

Then, I updated my layout_cshtml code and added a dropdown menu in it.
